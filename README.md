# DistributedSystemSimulation
This program simulates a distributed operating system. There is a master, 2 slaves, and 2 clients. Each slave is optimized to do a specific type of job. The client sends jobs, and the system decides which slave it would be more efficient to send it to based on the realtime workload of the slave. 
To run this program, first run master, then slave 1, slave 2, then the clients in either order.
